# Congestion Simulation

This is a simulation project I worked on in early 2020 to mimic a room full of people trying to exit through a door as quickly as possible. The simulation contained behaviors such as seeking the door, and avoiding walls and collisions with other people.

The simulation was built in Scala from the ground up, including the movement mechanics and the GUI. The movement mechanics were based on Craig Reynold's steering behaviors for autonomous characters ([link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2495826_Steering_Behaviors_For_Autonomous_Characters)).
